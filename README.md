## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

This is my second project with Vanilla JS and I had a lot of fun. JavaScript give us a lot of options to learn and to make dynamic web pages/applications. Also, I started using more SASS(SCSS) in my projects to make CSS writing faster and cleaner.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

I learned so much things doing this challenge. What is NodeList, how to loop through it and display error messages. Also, I learned how to use event function and listen to event.
